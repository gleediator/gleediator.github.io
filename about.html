Hi, I am Ivana. I was born and raised in Indonesia. I moved out when I was 17 because I got a scholarship to study in the Netherlands and from then on, my life has changed quiet a lot.

I enjoy traveling, preferably solo backpacking. Why? because the sitatuation enforces me to socialize with different people, mostly other backpackers and some very curious locals. Traveling teaches me to see a person as a person, no nationality - no baggage - just as an individual.
Prejudice is something I learn not to do, I value people as much as how they value themselves to me and that's how I have been living my life so far.

In the beginning of 2013 I traveled back to Indonesia for 3 weeks, it was an amazing trip for me. I met old friends, made new friends, and exchanged stories with them. Conversation over conversation - I learned that the minority, which in this case referes to people with sexual preference other than 'straight', is seen to be criminals and are defined to be sick in the head.

That makes me extremely sad and upset but I can understand why it happens. LGBT people are living in the shade of shame; in fact, you just cannot be gay. It's not just about annihilation, but also your safety. - so it's not uncommon to see closeted married homosexuals living 'normal' lifes in Indonesia.
This leads to


Not only that, the real problem is the youngsters.


My friends pointed out the lack of role models for young LGBTs, which based on their own experiences as well. They didn't know where to go, who to look up to, and how to survive. Sure there are celebrities, but no one really personal.

I was ashamley OK with that. I knew it since forever, I am aware of their culture, and the majority of the people in Indonesia have that mind set, so I accepted it as is.

That's ironic. I have always been bold, I speak up and always aim for what I want in life but when it comes to something so deeply personal, I shrunk. Later on I realized, I want to help and make Indonesia a safer place for minorities.


GOAL
My plan is to educate the public and to acknowlege the existance of LGBT community in hopes of creating a better and safer environtment for the community in Indonesia.

As for the youngsters, I hope that by showing different backgrounds, types, etc of LGBT - they would be able to find role models so they will be able to explore the world.

I was starting to realize that I need to do something t

Yes I do realize that the majority of Indonesian people are not open to
but just because everyblemme ody does it, does not mean it is ok.
















just because everybody does it does not mean that it is ok to accept it as is. I am not trying to scream up to your face


No, I don't party hard every weekend and have sex with random people.

No, I don't do one night stand. Ever.

No, just because I am gay doesn't mean that I will stare at all the women. I do have type, so stop flattering yourselves.

No, I never had a girlfriend.

Yes, I do know that I am gay.

Yes, I am a professional. I have my vision and career.


Not only that, the trip opened my eyes and made me realize that maybe I can finally help my community.







A bit about me
I came out when I was 20 - LA Gay Pride was my first pride ever.
I was born and raised as a Christian but
I have no isse with the religion











My life's changed a lot since I left Indonesia; maybe because I've been learning so much about life, maybe because I travel a lot that makes me lose my nationality (I see a person as a person when I backpack - not judging where they are from), or maybe because I accepted myself as I am. We all grow - that's the beauty of life.


I was born and raised as a Christian, I hated myself
teeneage years awas hell and I killed all of my feelings.

No I do not do one night stand, I do not party hard like how you percieve gay people. Indonesian people see us as criminals and I would like to change that. I would like to show several different shades and types of gay people - living their lifes as they are. Normal life if you would like to say it.

I would like to show to gay-Indonesian-teenagers several role models. Not just those famouse celebrities but also, us, gay people next door in hopes to open their minds and show them that things will be ok, you're gonna grow old with your soulmates, it is possible. \

It is possible. Everything is possible as long as you're brave enough to make it happen.

I am an explorer - I love travelling, tasting different food, talking to different people, and sharing my experiences with poeple.

I want people to see me as a human being, as I am; despite my gender, age, nationality, skin colour, and sexual preference.

No, I never want to scream out to your face that I am gay; and I have no intention to be an extremist so that the whole world will accept gay people.

Last trip I went to Indonesia, I made new friends and that was the first trip ever that involved 'gayness'.
