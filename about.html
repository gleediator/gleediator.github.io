				- How did it start -
				<span>So this is why I started the project...</span>
			</h1>

			<p>
				In the beginning of 2013 I traveled back to Indonesia for 3 weeks, it was an amazing trip for me. I met old friends, made new friends, and exchanged stories with them. Conversation over conversation - I learned that the minority, which in this case referes to people with sexual preference other than <strong>'straight'</strong>, is seen to be criminals and defined to be sick in the head.
			</p>
			<p>
				This makes me extremely sad and upset but I can understand why it happens. LGBT people are living in the shade of shame; in fact, you just cannot be not straight. It's not just about the exilation but worse, physical attack is uncommon. With this in mind, I can completely understand why LGBT people stay in the closet (it's not uncommon to see closeted married homosexuals living 'normal' lives in Indonesia).
			</p>
			<p>
				I was ashamedly OK with that. I knew it since forever, I am aware of their culture, and the majority of the people in Indonesia have that particular mind set, so I accepted it as is.
			</p>
			<p>
				That's ironic. I have always been bold, I speak up and always aim for what I want in life but when it comes to something so deeply personal, I shrunk. Later on something happened during my trip to Bandung that made me committed to help the community.
			</p>

			<h1>- The trip -</h1>
			<p>
				During my trip to Bandung, I got the chance to interview some of the people I met at an open minded club in Bali. The interview session was spontaneous - I just turned on my voice memo app on iPhone during one of our hangouts (with permission of course). They told me stories about their lives, which I found very intriguing &amp; interesting. Some of them are already out(ed), mostly by inevitable unpleasant incidents; most are still in the closet and have no interest to come out.
			</p>
			<p>
				I curiously asked why without thinking much about it, but their answers really affected me mentally. Most of them didn't even dare to think of the future; they've got a special bond with each other, like being a family, and dependant on each other heavily. After all, when you cannot run for a help to your parents because they cannot accept you as you are, who else can you ask help from but each other.

			<h1>- Unfolding the source -</h1>
			<p>
				Despite I was born in indonesia, I had spent most of my crucial years abroad. This is why I know their culture but I won't understand it. With this in mind, I gathered information from non-straight people I know, as well as some open minded mutual friends in Indonesia. I want to get off on the right foot with this project.
			</p>
			<p>
				These are the facts, for the public - LGBT community doesn't have good impression. They see it as a sickness, something you catch from hanging out with the wrong crowd and they believe that it can be cured. Personally I think it's caused by lack of example and education, it is hard to accept or like something that you don't know. Pure misconception.
			</p>
			<p>While for the LGBT community, they have been telling me the same thing over and over again. They didn't have any LGBT figures who they can look up to when they first figured out about their sexuality, even worse, all they heard about was constant negative comments. This made them feel hated, insecure and could lead them to an unhealthy lifestyle.</p>
			<p>
				Based on these, I am trying to find a way to create a platform that will be beneficial for both - the community as well as the public.
			</p>

			<article>
				<h1>- Insight -</h1>
				<p>Allow me to tell you a bit of my story. When I finally came out four years ago, I was worry so much that I would lose my family &amp; friends (I still haven't told my family btw.. so yea...). Yes, I read all about the "coming out guide" on different LGBT platforms but my case was a bit different, at least that's how I see it. One of my closest friends is very religious and I really didn't know how to tell her the truth without being turned off to. She meant a lot to me.
				</p>

				<p>When I finally got the chance and courage to tell her, she was surprisingly OK with that. She admitted that if it's not me then it might be a bit harder for her to accept. When I asked her why, she said that because she knows me personally, she knows that I mean no harm to people and that "you're just Ivana". She againsts gay bashing and speak up about it now.</p>

				<p>Because of that particular experience, I believe that it is important to come out. Not just for yourself, but also to help other LGBT people.
				<br>
				<span class="note">Note: when I said "come out", doesn't mean you have to wear rainbow shirt and yell that you're gay of course. I am not loud myself.</span>
				</p>

				<p>Anyway, enough blah blah - let's move on to the real deal!</p>

			<h1>- Gleediator -</h1>
			<p>Gleediator is a project to showcase several different types/layers of LGBT people. The idea is to expand how LGBT people are percieved in the public eye. I would like to show that the community is extremely diverse &amp; dynamic; in hope that there will be no more extreme misconceptions between us.
			</p>
			<p>My goal is to find as many LGBT people as I can with different professions and backgrounds, beg them to share their stories and make it available on this site.
			</p>
			<p>
			What I'd like to achieve for LGBT youth is to show several role models (who are not hollywood celebs) who they can look up to, to show that they can live an ordinary('normal') happy life. For the public (parents, etc) is to show that we are just ordinary people, we have feelings, we have hope, and we have zero intention to spread the gay desease and make the whole world to be gay. Trust me, we're not. And nope, we're also not contagious.
