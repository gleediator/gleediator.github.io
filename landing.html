					Hi, I am Ivana. I was born and raised in Indonesia. I moved out when I was 17 because I got a scholarship to study in the Netherlands and from then on, my life has changed quiet a lot.
				</p>
				<p>
					I enjoy traveling, preferably solo backpacking. Why? because the sitatuation enforces me to socialize with different people, mostly other backpackers and some very curious locals. Traveling teaches me to see a person as a person, no nationality - no baggage - just as an individual. (opens my mind?)
					<br>
					Prejudice is something I learn not to do, I value people as much as how they value themselves to me and that's how I have been living my life so far.

			<h1>- Part II -</h1>
			<p>
				In the beginning of 2013 I traveled back to Indonesia for 3 weeks, it was an amazing trip for me. I met old friends, made new friends, and exchanged stories with them. Conversation over conversation - I learned that the minority, which in this case referes to people with sexual preference other than <strong>'straight'</strong>, is seen to be criminals and are defined to be sick in the head.
			</p>
			<p>
				That makes me extremely sad and upset but I can understand why it happens. LGBT people are living in the shade of shame; in fact, you just cannot be gay. It's not just about the exilation but worse, physical attack is uncommon. With this in mind, I can completely understand why LGBT people stay in the closet (it's not uncommon to see closeted married homosexuals living 'normal' lifes in Indonesia).
