					Hi, I am Ivana. I was born and raised in Indonesia. I moved out when I was 17 because I got a scholarship to study in the Netherlands and from then on, my life has changed quiet a lot.
				</p>
				<p>
					I enjoy traveling, preferably solo backpacking. Why? because the sitatuation enforces me to socialize with different people, mostly other backpackers and some very curious locals. Traveling teaches me to see a person as a person, no nationality - no baggage - just as an individual. (opens my mind?)
					<br>
					Prejudice is something I learn not to do, I value people as much as how they value themselves to me and that's how I have been living my life so far.

			<h1>- How did it start -</h1>
			<p>
				In the beginning of 2013 I traveled back to Indonesia for 3 weeks, it was an amazing trip for me. I met old friends, made new friends, and exchanged stories with them. Conversation over conversation - I learned that the minority, which in this case referes to people with sexual preference other than <strong>'straight'</strong>, is seen to be criminals and are defined to be sick in the head.
			</p>
			<p>
				That makes me extremely sad and upset but I can understand why it happens. LGBT people are living in the shade of shame; in fact, you just cannot be gay. It's not just about the exilation but worse, physical attack is uncommon. With this in mind, I can completely understand why LGBT people stay in the closet (it's not uncommon to see closeted married homosexuals living 'normal' lifes in Indonesia).
			</p>
			<p>
				I was ashamley OK with that. I knew it since forever, I am aware of their culture, and the majority of the people in Indonesia have that particular mind set, so I accepted it as is.
			</p>
			<p>
				That's ironic. I have always been bold, I speak up and always aim for what I want in life but when it comes to something so deeply personal, I shrunk. Later on something happened during my trip to Bandung that made me committed to help the community.

			<h1>- Current Situation(Why necessary) -</h1>
			<p>
				During my trip to Bandung, I got the chance to interview some of the people I met at a gay club in Bali. They told me stories about their lifes, which I found very interesting. Some of them are already outed, mostly by inevitable unpleasant incidents; most are still in the closet and have no interest to come out.
			</p>
			<p>
				I curiously asked why without thinking much about it, but their answers really affected my point of view. They didn't even dare to think of the future, they build a strong relationship with their friends that makes them family who they can always count on.

				I asked, how do they think I could help. And here is what they ask me to do.
